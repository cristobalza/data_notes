#Model Evaluation and Selection

## Introduction: What is accuracy? How to estimate or calculate it?

So far, we have heard from different techniques such as  **cross-validation**,  **holdout**, or **bootstrap** from Statistics that are use to train our model and see how well it does for the various purposes that we want.

However, sometimes it is hard to choose what Classifier, model, algorithm to use. What are the exact things we should be looking at when evaluation and selecting a model in Machine Learning.

## Performance of a Model

We know the deal of using the training set to create some model that eventually will measure the **accuracy** of some model when predicting on a test set. Besides, accuracy we can also test for other things such as:
- **Recall**  
- **Precision**
- **F scores**
